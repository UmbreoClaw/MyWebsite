      <h2>Pear's response to the allegiation</h2>
      <p>After reading over the response, I have to say that this is false. I've attached a piece of irrefutable evidence that says otherwise. This evidence was uncovered by BRNBot3+, whose bravery and persistence I applaud. Signed and verified by Pear on the 22nd September 2024.</p>
