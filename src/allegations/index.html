      <h2>Pear's response to the allegation response</h2>
      <p>After reading over the response, I have to say that this is false. I've attached a piece of irrefutable evidence that says otherwise. This evidence was uncovered by BRNBot3+, whose bravery and persistence I applaud. Signed and verified by Pear on the 22nd September 2024.</p>

      <h2>My Response to Pear's Response to The Allegation Response</h2>
      <p>After carefully and meticulously foraging through the evidence provided I have decided to deem what was said false. First off BRNBot3+ had depicted Pear as the mean Pearjak and ME as the innocent catjak. Secondly... I am literally a cat ????? I literally can't bark ??? So that is literally just made up like...</p>

      <h2>Pear's Response to Umbreo's Response to My Response</h2>
      <p>Umbreo, of all people to have ever lived, surely you must understand that art is subjective. For goodness sake, you have an exhibition of furry art. It is unmistakable that BRNBot3+ has depicted me as the "chad" Pearjak and you as the weakling catjak. To say otherwise is to concede your ignorance of the sophistication of analyzing intricate artwork. Historically, people with guns have usually won&mdash;many such cases. Therefore, your opinions are invalid. This is literally how I imagined you (all the way down to the Trumpesque red tie) when I read your response, seriously!!</p>
