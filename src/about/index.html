      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        Hiya! If you are reading this, I am UmbreoClaw, a silly and rather unserious catto on the internet. 
        Originally this sentence said that I would be writing more stuff here but I haven't yet and most likely won't for the forseeable future! But I might when I think of something, so keep those eyes peeled.

      <h2>The One Behind the Scenes</h2>
      <p>
        This website couldn't be possible without my friend Pear! 
        <br> They're the one who used their magic website coding skills to bring this (and the other pages!) to life.
        <br> You can check him out on <a href="https://github.com/TheRealPear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">GitHub as TheRealPear</a>!
        <br> Update: They didn't 'code' it per se but they set it up.. Same difference (Nerd)
